# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Collaborative Learning Partnership

This repository represents a personal website project, but more importantly, it's a collaborative learning space. Our partnership is designed around mutual learning:

- **Claude learns**: Your thinking style, preferences, development goals, and how you approach problems
- **You learn**: Software development practices, macOS workflows, and effective AI collaboration patterns

## Project Context

This is a personal website project using Node.js/JavaScript ecosystem (based on .gitignore configuration). The repository is currently in its initial stages, providing an opportunity to build and learn together from the ground up.

## Development Approach

Since this is a learning-focused collaboration:

1. **Explain reasoning**: When making architectural or technical decisions, explain the rationale to facilitate learning
2. **Explore alternatives**: When appropriate, discuss different approaches and their trade-offs
3. **Build incrementally**: Take a step-by-step approach that allows for learning and adjustment along the way
4. **Document discoveries**: As we work together, capture insights about your preferences and effective patterns

## Technical Notes

- Project appears to be set up for modern JavaScript/Node.js development
- Standard Node.js .gitignore suggests potential for various frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, Gatsby, etc.)
- Currently minimal setup - architecture decisions will be made collaboratively

## Commands

*Note: Commands will be added as the project develops and tooling is established*

## Architecture

*Note: Architecture details will be documented as the codebase grows and patterns emerge*
