# Session Log - Personal Website Project

This file tracks our collaborative sessions, progress, and learnings to maintain continuity between Claude Code sessions.

## Session 1 - Foundation & CI/CD Setup
**Date**: June 16, 2025  
**Duration**: Extended session  
**Focus**: Repository foundation, automation, and safety workflows

### Major Accomplishments

#### üîß **Infrastructure & Automation**
- **GitHub MCP Integration**: Successfully configured GitHub Model Control Protocol
  - Verified read/write access to repository
  - Tested file content retrieval and comparison
  - Identified permission limitations (PR creation requires manual approach)

- **Local Validation System**: Created `validate.sh` script
  - HTML validation (with html5validator when installed)
  - Basic file structure checks
  - CLAUDE.md existence verification
  - Executable script ready for pre-push validation

- **Dual-Workflow CI/CD Architecture**: 
  - **CI Validation** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Runs on all branches/PRs
    - HTML validation using html5validator
    - File structure verification
    - Creates "Validate Code" status check
  - **Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): Runs only on main branch
    - Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
    - Respects environment protection rules

#### üìö **Documentation & Knowledge Capture**
- **Enhanced CLAUDE.md**: Comprehensive project guidance
  - Security and safety principles
  - Feature branch workflow documentation
  - Command reference and best practices
  - GitHub setup requirements
- **Architecture Documentation**: Detailed CI/CD pipeline explanation

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Best Practices**
- **Safety-First Approach**: Documented core safety guidelines
- **Environment Protection**: Resolved GitHub Pages deployment restrictions
- **Branch Protection Planning**: Prepared for requiring PR reviews and status checks

### Technical Challenges Resolved

#### **GitHub Pages Environment Protection Error**
- **Problem**: Feature branches couldn't deploy due to environment protection rules
- **Root Cause**: Single workflow trying to deploy from all branches
- **Solution**: Separated validation (all branches) from deployment (main only)
- **Result**: Feature branches now validate safely without deployment attempts

#### **Status Checks Discovery**
- **Challenge**: GitHub UI doesn't show status checks until they've run at least once
- **Approach**: Created test PR to trigger workflow execution
- **Current Status**: Workflows running, but checks not yet appearing in branch protection UI

### Collaboration Patterns Established

#### **Structured Task Management**
- Consistent use of TodoWrite for complex, multi-step tasks
- Real-time progress tracking and completion marking
- Clear prioritization (high/medium/low)

#### **Safety-Driven Development**
- Local validation before every push (`./validate.sh`)
- Feature branch workflow for all changes
- Documentation-first approach for decisions

#### **Learning-Focused Partnership**
- Explained technical decisions and reasoning
- Explored alternatives and trade-offs
- Built incrementally with adjustment opportunities

### Current State

#### **Working Systems**
- ‚úÖ Local development environment
- ‚úÖ GitHub MCP integration
- ‚úÖ Validation workflows
- ‚úÖ Documentation system
- ‚úÖ GitHub CLI access

#### **Outstanding Issues**
- ‚è≥ **Status Checks Mystery**: CI workflows run but don't appear in branch protection UI
  - Possible causes: Need run on main branch, UI delay, naming convention
  - Impact: Cannot complete branch protection rule setup yet

#### **Ready for Next Session**
- üöÄ Repository foundation is solid
- üöÄ Safety workflows established
- üöÄ Ready to begin feature development
- üöÄ Automation tools configured and tested

### Tools & Technologies
- **Primary Stack**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (dual-workflow architecture)
- **Validation**: html5validator, custom bash scripts
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow
- **Automation**: GitHub MCP, GitHub CLI
- **Documentation**: Markdown (CLAUDE.md, SESSION_LOG.md)

### Next Session Goals
1. **Resolve status checks** - Get branch protection fully operational
2. **Begin feature development** - Navigation, content sections, styling
3. **Apply established workflow** - Use feature branches with full validation pipeline
4. **Continue collaborative learning** - Build on established patterns

### Session Insights
- **Collaboration Quality**: Strong partnership with clear communication
- **Technical Foundation**: Robust, scalable architecture established  
- **Safety Implementation**: Comprehensive guardrails in place
- **Learning Approach**: Balanced explanation with hands-on implementation
